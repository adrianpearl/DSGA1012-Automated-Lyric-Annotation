When I say ‘parade’ I am talking about the actual party and everybody having a good time, and making this feel like we have grown. We are feeling like we are adults, but really we don’t know shit. We are just faking it and living carefree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "3  In 2013, Kendrick’s friend Chad Keaton died from complications about a month after a drive-by shooting.  Kendrick was overseas when Chad died. He didn’t visit him in hospital, but  just spoke to him on Skype . Inevitably, Kendrick feels like a failure for not going to see his dying friend in person. He feels like even God couldn’t forgive him for what he’s done, being too preoccupied with his career to be able to visit Chad before he passed.  Kendrick is later confronted by God on  “How Much A Dollar Cost,”  where he  fails God’s test.  https://twitter.com/kendricklamar/status/375316718823800832   \n",
